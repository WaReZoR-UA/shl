									<p class="content__paragraph">Maybe you realize that what we are talking about is making a decision about your contractor. We don’t exaggerate when we say that this might be the most important thing you have to make very cautious decisions about because the quality of the contractor's work must be impeccable. So, it might be worth a while to spend some time in the beginning and do your research about all the companies that you are considering to avoid paying for a bad job later.</p>

								<h2 class="content__title">The following are some of the steps we think are essential in choosing the right company:</h2>
								<div class="content__text">
									<p class="content__paragraph">Make sure your general contractor has all the required insurances and certificates regarding the job itself and the workers. This is essential because a client is not supposed to be liable for any issues related to such matters. You can find the insurance information about general contractors on the Department of Labor website by simply looking up their license number.</p>
									<p class="content__paragraph">Pay close attention to the legitimacy of the company. See if they have their own website or social media presence and how extensive it is. Social media nowadays is a driver in showing the true side of the companies because you can see what they post and when they post it which helps to understand whether they are in the know etc.</p>
									<p class="content__paragraph">Look at the past projects and reviews from the clients on the company’s website. Companies that are proud to show off their work will want everybody else to see and the most efficient way to let the perspective clients know is to put it up on their website. This could be a good indicator of the service you potentially might be receiving.</p>
									<p class="content__paragraph">Try to meet up for a walkthrough and discuss the proposal in person. This establishes the connection between you and a potential contractor as well as providing you with a chance to see how they act and how they respond to the requests from you as a client. Be genuine and frank in your feedback to them.</p>
